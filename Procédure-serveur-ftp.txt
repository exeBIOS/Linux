##FTP server configuration

###Introduction
VSFTP allows you to secure an FTP server using SSL or TLS protocols.

The objective of this part is to install a Debian server on which we will add an FTP service.

###Installation and configuration

###Installation
```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install vsftpd openssl```

###Key generation
```ll -d /etc/ssl/private```

Check that the rights on this directory are 700. Otherwise, run the appropriate command for this.

And if the directory does not exist, create it and assign it rights 700.

We now create the key:

```openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:3072 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd_key.pem -out /etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
....++++++
.....++++++
writing new private key to '/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd_key.pem'

The following questions must now be answered:

```You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

```Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:FR
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:<Entrer la ville (Pau)>
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:<ORGANISME DE FORMATION>
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:<NOM DE LA FORMATION>
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:example.com
Email Address []:<admin@example.com>```
